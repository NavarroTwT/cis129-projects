print('It is a cold evening, and Coleman is in a convenience store to buy snacks to eat later.')
print('After Coleman bought the snacks and had left the convenience store, he sensed that something was wrong because he had seen something strange.')
print('Coleman rubs his eyes, thinking that maybe he had just seen something because he was tired. He blinks once more, and after opening his eyes, he becomes too stunned to speak.')
print('Coleman had realized that he was not on the street that took him to his house.')
print('But instead was in a different world filled with unique creatures and people who spoke a language he could not understand. He was lost.')
